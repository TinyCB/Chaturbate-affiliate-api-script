# TinyCB - Chaturbate affiliate website / script

TinyCB is a small sand simple script that fetches models from Chaturbate's API feed and create your own free cam site. 

02/03/2019 - Updated script to responsive design including IFRAME. Sadly, because of how Chaturbate has set the IFRAME, it's not possible to get it 100% right.

If you find something not working as intended, please send me a message.

## Setup

1. [Sign up at Chaturbate](https://chaturbate.com/in/?track=default&tour=9O7D&campaign=2DLMP)
2. Download and unzip the archive [here](https://github.com/Kudocams/TinyCB/archive/master.zip).
3. Go to functions/edit.php and change everything accordingly.
4. Upload all files to your server.
5. Make sure chaturbate.xml is writable.

NOTE: Tested script with PHP7 and works.

NOTE: It is recommended to set display_errors=Off in your php.ini file.
      Alternatively, if you don't have access to php.ini you can turn off error reporting by adding
      error_reporting(0); to index.php or php_flag display_errors off to your htaccess file.

## Cache and speed

This script makes use of a very simple xml caching method. It pr√© downloads the feed from Chaturbate and then saves it to a local xml file on your server.
There's no need to setup any cron jobs etc.
