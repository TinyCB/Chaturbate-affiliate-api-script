## ‚ö°Ô∏è Setup

### 1. **Clone this project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPO.git
cd YOURREPO
```

### 2. **Permissions**
Make sure the following are **writable by your web server**:
- `config.php`
- `cache/` directory
- `assets/` directory

### 3. **Fetch/Cron setup**
Run the script to cache live model data:
```bash
php fetch-and-cache.php
```
For live updating, set up a cron to call this script every few minutes (adjust as needed).

### 4. **.htaccess**
The repo includes a working `.htaccess` for clean URLs out of the box.  
**No changes needed** (unless you put this in a subdirectory).

### 5. **Open in your browser**  
Go to your site root (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/`) ‚Äì you‚Äôll see the live cam grid!

## üîë Admin/Config

### **Access the Admin Page**
- Go to `/admin.php` (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/admin.php`).
- **Default admin password:**  
  ```
  changeme
  ```

### **Changing the Admin Password**
- Log in with `changeme`.
- Use the ‚ÄúChange Admin Password‚Äù fields at the bottom of the admin page.
- After saving, your new password is active.

### **What You Can Configure**
- Site name, primary color, logo
- Filters per page
- SEO/meta for homepage and gender pages
- Nav bar links for "Login" and "Broadcast Yourself" (URLs set in the admin panel)
- Affiliate ID, whitelabel domain

_All settings are saved instantly to `config.php`._

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- **Mobile design:** Not fully mobile responsive yet; best viewed on desktop for now.
- **No database:** All data/settings are stored in flat files.
- **Cache:** Only the models listed in your cache are shown. Update with the fetch script.
- **All URLs are pretty (`/girls/page/2`), no query strings for filters or pages._

## ü§î Troubleshooting

- If you get blank model grids: make sure `cache/` is writable and `fetch-and-cache.php` has run.
- If AJAX/filters are blank: check browser dev tools and ensure `/api-proxy.php` is reachable.
- To reset admin: manually delete or edit `admin_password_hash` in `config.php`.
