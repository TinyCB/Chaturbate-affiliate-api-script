# Chaturbate affiliate API script

## About TinyCB

TinyCB is a small Chaturbate affiliate script (written in PHP) that you can deploy on your server. What it does is, it downloads Chaturbate's XML API feed on your own server and uses that file to parse the models on your website. This script comes with a default template (mobile ready). To change the default template, it is recommended to have some basic knowledge about HTML / CSS / PHP.

Furthermore, TinyCB should be easy to setup (no programming knowledge required). All values are predefined in the edit.php file.

## Setup

1. [Sign up at Chaturbate](https://chaturbate.com/in/?track=default&tour=9O7D&campaign=2DLMP)
2. Download and unzip the archive [here](https://github.com/Kudocams/TinyCB/archive/master.zip).
3. Change edit.php accordingly.
4. Upload all files to your server.
5. Make sure chaturbate.xml is writable.

NOTE: Tested script with PHP7 and works.

NOTE: It is recommended to set display_errors=Off in your php.ini file.
      Alternatively, if you don't have access to php.ini you can turn off error reporting by adding
      error_reporting(0); to index.php or php_flag display_errors off to your htaccess file.

## Cache and speed

This script makes use of a very simple xml caching method. It pr√© downloads the feed from Chaturbate and then saves it to a local xml file on your server.
There's no need to setup any cron jobs etc.
