## ‚ú® Features
- **Lightning-fast local caching:** All cam grid and model data is fetched and stored as flat JSON files for speed and reliability.
- **Live grid filtering:** Filter models instantly by gender, region, room size, age, and tag (#hashtags).
- **Pretty, clean URLs:** Navigate via `/girls/`, `/guys/`, `/trans/`, `/couples/`, or directly by `/model/username`.
- **Clickable tags everywhere:** Hashtags (in grid & sidebar) instantly update filters, for super quick navigation.
- **Auto-refresh mode (desktop):** Optional toggle in the header. When enabled, automatically refreshes the grid every minute‚Äînew models appear, offline models disappear, and all data stays up-to-date (subject line, viewer counts, even thumbnails!).
- **Profile fallback for offline models:** If a model goes offline, their profile page (avatar, stats, bio, tags, etc) is still preserved and accessible at `/model/username`.
- **Automated model bio writing (AI):** Generate model bios automatically with OpenAI (e.g. GPT-4/4o/3.5-turbo) or Ollama (local, e.g. Mistral, Gemma, Qwen, etc.), with creative variety and admin control.
- **Modern tooltips & hover highlights:** All tags/controls give clear hover feedback (with colored backgrounds) for a polished feel.
- **Full admin panel:** Edit all nav links, meta tags, site colors, slugs, logo, LLM settings, and more instantly in your browser.
- **"Rewrite all bios" feature:** Regenerate all bios in one batch when you want to improve style or change LLMs/backends.
- **True 404 error handling:** Offline/missing model pages return a real HTTP 404 Not Found code for proper SEO.
- **No database required:** Portable and easy to deploy anywhere PHP runs.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Setup

### 1. **Clone this project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPO.git
cd YOURREPO
```
Or download and unzip [here](https://github.com/Kudocams/TinyCB/archive/master.zip).

After downloading, [sign up at Chaturbate](https://chaturbate.com/in/?track=default&tour=9O7D&campaign=2DLMP) to get your affiliate ID.

### 2. **Permissions**
Make sure the following are **writable by your web server**:
- `config.php`
- `cache/` directory (create manually if needed; this is where cached files and offline profiles are stored)
- `assets/` directory

### 3. **Fetch/Cron setup**
Run the script to cache live model data:
```bash
php fetch-and-cache.php
```
> **NOTE:**  
> The script also maintains `model_profiles.json` (an archive of all models ever seen), which is used to display offline profile pages.
Set up a cron job to call this script every few minutes (adjust as desired for freshness).

### 4. **Generate bios with AI (Optional)**
To generate bios for all models, run:
```bash
php generate-bio.php
```
- This uses the LLM/backend/URL/model/API key you set in admin (see below).
- Runs in batch, saves every 5 bios. Safely resumable!
- Enable "Rewrite all bios" in admin to force all bios to update.

### 5. **.htaccess**
Repo includes a ready-to-go `.htaccess` for clean URLs out of the box.

### 6. **Open in your browser**  
Go to your site root (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/`) ‚Äì you‚Äôll see the live cam grid and profiles!

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- **AI Provider/model:** Choose from OpenAI (with your own API key) or run locally with Ollama or anything OpenAI-compatible.
- **memory_limit:** Set to at least `256M` or `512M` in `php.ini` as `model_profiles.json` (used for offline profile pages) can quickly hit 50MB+.  
  If you do not have php.ini access, set at the top of your script:
  ```php
  ini_set('memory_limit', '256M');
  ```
- **Mobile design:** Not fully responsive yet‚Äîuse on desktop for now.
- **No database:** All data/settings are flat files.
- **Grid/listings:** Only models in your latest cache appear in the public grid; profiles for all archived models remain accessible.
- **SEO:** All URLs are pretty (`/girls/page/2` etc.), no query strings.
- **Feature requests, issues, and PRs are welcome!**
- **AI output:** Use safe, on-brand, non-PII prompts and review generated bios regularly if using OpenAI or other cloud providers.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

- Blank grid? Make sure `cache/` is writable and `fetch-and-cache.php` has run.
- AJAX/filters not working? Use browser dev tools to check `/api-proxy.php`.
- Can't write bios/config? Check permissions on `cache/` and `config.php`.
- To reset admin: delete or edit `admin_password_hash` in `config.php`.
